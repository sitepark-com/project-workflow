# Setup for composer projects

## Manage access

In (packagist.org)[https://packagist.org/] a user `sitepark` is created. This is linked to the `sitepark-bot` user of GitLab to manage the webhooks for packagist.org. See also: [How to update packages?](https://packagist.org/about#how-to-update-packages)
To manage the webhooks for the composer projects, the `sitepark-bot` account for composer projects needs the `Admin` role.
